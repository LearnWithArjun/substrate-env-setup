# Let's get the Substrate front-end template set up on your computer!
The front-end template uses ReactJS to render a web browser interface that enables you to interact with the Substrate-based blockchain node. You can use this Front-end template as a starting point for creating user interfaces for your own projects in future.
The front-end template requires [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you don't have these tools, install them first.
### To install the front-end template:
1. Open a new terminal window on your computer.
2. Check whether node is installed on your local computer by running the following command:
```
node --version
```
If the command doesn’t return a version number, download and install `node` by following the instructions for the operating system you use on the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) website. The `node` version should be at least v14 to run the front-end template.
3. Check whether yarn is installed on your local computer by running the following command:
```
yarn --version
```
The `yarn` version should be at least v3 to run the front-end template. You can use `yarn version` and specify a version number to update `yarn` if you have an older version installed. If the command doesn’t return a version number, download and install `yarn` by running the following command:
```
npm install --global yarn
```
4. Clone the front-end template repository by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template
```
5. Change to the root of the front-end template directory by running the following command:
```
cd substrate-front-end-template
```
6. Install the dependencies for the front-end template by running the following command:
```
yarn install
```
